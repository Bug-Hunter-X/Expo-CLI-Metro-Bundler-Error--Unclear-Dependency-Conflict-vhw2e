While using Expo CLI, I encountered an error related to the metro bundler. The error message was vague and didn't pinpoint the exact problem. After much debugging, I found that the issue stemmed from a dependency conflict, where two packages required different versions of a core module. This conflict was not immediately apparent in the package.json file because the conflicting dependencies were nested several levels deep.
