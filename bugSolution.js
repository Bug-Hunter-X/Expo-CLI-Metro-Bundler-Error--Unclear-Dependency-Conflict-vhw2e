The solution involves carefully examining the dependency tree.  Tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why` can help.  Once identified, you can resolve the conflict by either updating packages or using package resolutions to force a particular version of the conflicting dependency. Here is how to resolve using package.json resolution:

```json
{
  // ... other configuration ...
  "resolutions": {
    "conflicting-package": "^1.0.0" //Replace conflicting-package and version as needed
  }
}
```

This forces a specific version of the conflicting-package resolving the issue.  Always ensure the forced version is compatible with all other dependencies.
